    <div class="title">Vegan</div>
      <p>No animals were harmed in the making of your food. Well, there is the part where it came here on a truck and killed, like, a million bugs. But those don't count. These menu items will help you avoid killing animals, even the dangerous and tasty ones. I hope you're proud of yourself</p>

  <section class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12" id="section2">
    <div class="title">Meatless</div>
      <p>We get it. It's hard to give up eggs, milk, and cheese. Those things are pretty good. This menu lets you feel a little less guilty because all of our products are cruelty-free. We do trick the chickens to get the eggs, but we're pretty sure they find it as funny as we do.</p>

  <section class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12" id="section3">
    <div class="title">Carnivore</div>
      <p>If you hate animals and love the taste of suffering, then we don't mind. The animals don't either. They're already dead. There's no point letting all that good meat go to waste, so have at it. Eat something that shares a lot of your DNA.</p>
